# Density estimator

I implemented two types of estimator, a diagonal Gaussian parametric density estimator and a Parzen density estimator with an isotropic Gaussian kernel. Then, I used them on the iris flower dataset to estimate the density of different features.

The Iris flower dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.
